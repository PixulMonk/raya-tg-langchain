# Raya ChatGPT Integration

This project integrates **Groq's Llama 3** model into a Telegram bot using **LangChain**, for conversational AI experimentation and personal productivity.

**Raya** is my custom-built AI assistant — designed to help with tasks like reminders, alerts, and potentially much more. It's built not just to test models, but to actually be useful in daily life.

## ✨ Features

- LangChain-powered natural language processing
- Telegram bot interface for real-time interaction
- Designed for extensibility: appointments, alerts, plugins, and more

## ⚙️ Stack

- **Python 3.12**
- **LangChain**
- **Groq Llama 3**
- **Telegram Bot API**
- **AsyncIO / aiohttp**

## 📌 Why?

This isn’t just a toy — it’s a hands-on, evolving assistant I actually use. It lets me explore LangChain in a meaningful way while building a bot I’ll rely on day-to-day.

## 🚧 Status

Prototype is functional. Core loop works. Next steps: memory integration, background task scheduling, and multi-model support.
